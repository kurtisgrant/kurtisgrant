### 🗺 My programming journey:
#### 🌱 2011) Hello, World
I was introduced to programming many moons ago in 2011 when I had the privilege of attending Queens University's "SEEDS" (Seven Eight Enrichment Days) program. This is where I wrote my first `print("Hello, World!")` in Python.
####  🚢 2020) The outset
- In June of 2020, I dove back into programming and I have been learning computer science and web development consistently ever since.
- Completed: 
  - **Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science** in Dec 2020
  - **Eloquent JavaScript** in Feb 2021
  - and several smaller courses and personal projects
 
#### 🧑🏻‍💻 2021/22) Where are they now?
I can currently be observed swimming in coursework generously provided by **Lighthouse Labs**, the web development bootcamp I'm expecting to graduate from in Feb of 2022.
