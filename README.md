### 🗺 My programming journey:

#### 🌱 2011) Hello, World
I was introduced to programming many moons ago in 2011 when I had the privilege of attending Queens University's "SEEDS" (Seven Eight Enrichment Days) program. This is where I wrote my first `print("Hello, World!")` in Python.

####  🚢 2020) The outset
- In June of 2020, I dove back into programming and I have been learning computer science and web development consistently ever since.
- Completed: 
  - **Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science** in Dec 2020
  - **Eloquent JavaScript** in Feb 2021
  - and several smaller courses and personal projects
 
#### 🧑🏻‍💻 2022) Where are they now?
Having recently graduated from **Lighthouse Labs**, I can be found at my computer keeping my skills sharp, working on interesting projects, contributing to open-source software and patiently waiting for my knight in shining armour (or gainful employment, I'll take either).
